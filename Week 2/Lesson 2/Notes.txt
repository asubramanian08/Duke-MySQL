INTRODUCTION TO QUERY SYNTAX: -V
DQL: Data Query Language (only be covering)
Group of SQL code is a query
Enter the query into the 'front end interface'(FEI)
The above interfaces vary wildly
All queries start with 'SELECT'
Later line ask the format, the database, and the exact data
6 SQL keywords:
    SELECT (required) the data I want
    FROM (required) these database and tables
    WHERE these criteria are met, and
    GROUP (BY) this field
    HAVING this property, then
    ORDER (BY) this field or list
Queries usually end with ';'
Never specify how to execute a query
Recommend to make each claus on a separate line (with a keyword on it)
Have coworkers review your query
Table and column tables -> don't write uppercase
can call a function () like SUM
Use a period to specify table of column, ex: color.red
0 != no data, to do that saw NULL
2 systems we will be working with:
        Dataset     |   Database    |       FEI         
    ----------------|---------------|-------------------
        Dognition   |   MySQL       |   Jupyter         
        Dillard's   |   Teradata    |   SQL scratchpad  

HOW TO USE JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS: -V
Jupyter is a FEI (see above)
Made from collaboration
Helps instructor comment and help with her examples
Jupyter will be easier so do that first, then teradata
Press open and it will open a notebook, there is a cell to write code
Put the code in the In[] box.
Press the run cell, a '*' will be there while its running
When running a long query it will impact group of 150
There are some safe guards the instructors made to make it less likely to crash
Only get 1,000 rows
Clear output if you don't need it (wastes energy) Cell -> current output -> clear
To quit a query: click the stop (square)
The type of a cell can to changed on a tool bar (code, markdown ...)
Edit the order of the cells with arrows, cut, paste, copy
"Jupyter has a great help resource"
Can add cells as a Jupyter cell (I will download the notebooks)

HOW TO USE YOUR JUPYTER ACCOUNT: -V
Shut down a notebook when not being used -> save processing
Can edit the notebook that I have ..., folders, rename
The link to a lesson won't work if a notebook is renamed

HOW TO USE JUPYTER (WRITTEN INTRODUCTIONS): -R
Says almost the exact same thing as the video

https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-mysql/lecture/wev1k/how-to-use-your-jupyter-account
Each jupyter file is called a notebook
Clear output of a query, links to the notebooks, running -> shutdown notebooks
