INTRODUCTION TO TERADATA: -R
We are learning sql to get info from a database without asking someone else
Will be harder than the jupyter interface because there is no guiding text
These exercises will be given even less guidance
Teradata is quite fast so gain an understanding of what queries take time
Answers to the teradata exercises are not given -> use quiz to see if answers are right
Another part of an analyst job is to write good queries and understand the database
Goals:
    Week 2: use teradata easily and note differences
    Week 3: easily use the main keywords and be able to summarize data
    Week 4/5: covert analysis question into a query, convent data from the way they are stored in the DB
