## Duke-MySQL

### Organization

The course is divided by week then by lesson number. In each lesson there is the name of the lesson and my notes on what was taught. Some lessons have pdfs on the material or questions on what was taught. There are jupyter notebooks as well as sql files to show what queries I wrote. At the end of every week there is a quiz, the questions and solutions are in that lesson.

### About

I took [Duke's Managing Big Data with MySQL](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-mysql) course on coursera duing summer of 2021. I knew very little about MySQL going into the course but it taught me about how to actually handle data.
