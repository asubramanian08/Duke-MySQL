START WITH AN ANALYSIS PLAN: -V
As a business analyst you have to clarity with the business should do to fix a problem
Make this process quick and efficient, keep stakeholders posted
Make a plan to analyze the data before actually looking at it
Value is created from a decision and plan of action that is feasible not necessarily ideal
Always be thinking about:
    "What questions will provide valuable insight?"
    "Will the answers to my questions matter?"
    "Are the answers to my questions correct?" -> aggregate queries
Analysis Paralysis: there are too many ways to look at some data that you don't do any of them
Analysis Free For All: keep looking at what might be interesting instead of creating value
Both problems start when you first look at data to understand what it is about 
    -> "biasing strategy"
    -> make a plan before hand
    -> then look at the data and do the analysis
Structured Pyramid Analysis Plans (SPAP) 
    -> important to be done before looking at data
    -> one is already provided
    -> BELOW IS THE ORDERING OF EVERYTHING
SMART Goal: Top of the pyramid
    -> Specific
    -> Measurable
    -> Attainable
    -> Relevant
    -> Time Bound
Dependent variable: Underneath the SMART goal
Expanding catagories of issues that form the pyramid shape: In the second section
    -> "Under normal circumstances these categories would be derived from conversations with your stakeholders
    and your analysis team during a process called elicitation"
    -> write the column names and process needed (Independent Variable) -> easier to write queries
Data analysis is far from the only thing involved in the project
