WHAT ARE JOINS: -V
NOTE: this is for a one to one relationship
Breaking large set into tables
Joins: Class of sql commands to use tables together
Might be hard to understand -> know fundamentals
Looking up / searching is slow to operations
Use set theory to solve this problem
Multiples the 2 sets to make a table / combination
This can get messy for duplicate rows or many-to-many
Can't use null values to link tables
Inner join: value is contained in both unique columns of the table
Outer join: keep the rows of the first table and add conns. for those in second
    The first / second is determined if its is a LEFT join or RIGHT join
FULL outer join: keeps all the data if doesn't match (many DB don't support it)

JOINS WITH MANY-TO-MANY RELATIONSHIP AND DUPLICATES: -V
Many to many: first join the assignment table with the first table, then join that with the second
Most times, the types of joins are not varied when joining multiple tables.
Joins keep duplicate rows -> they will multiply and make many useless rows
Solution: clean data -> rid of duplicates, small examples, break down each join

A NOTE ABOUT OUR JOIN EXAMPLES: -V
In text books there aren't any null values for linking keys and or duplicate rows
This can be an example of real life -> start ups
