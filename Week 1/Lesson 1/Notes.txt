PROBLEM WITH HAVING A LOT OF DATA USED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE: -V
Why not put everything in a spreadsheet
Excel could crash, line up of people trying to open
Multiple spreadsheets created -> find right one
People Writing over the same thing
If one thing changes / there is a mistake -> many thing have to change
There is a separate analyses spreadsheets that can't constantly be up to date
Problems to solve: speed in queries, updates, handle many people, consistent, secure, fast, space

HOW REGINAL DATABASES HELP SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS: -V
Breaks up the data (faster to add and find)-> table, one  common relationship
Be able to link table to the tables -> a column that links (~id)
Don't need to be in sync row for row
Set theory:
    set: collection of things that has common features
    table is combination of the set of rows and columns
    Math shows how to combine / manipulate data
Requirements of RDB:
    Tables = smallest subset of data
    column - unique category information
    row - unique
    order of rows and columns doesn't matter
RDB can help prevent mistakes
