DATABASE DESIGN TOOLS THAT WILL HELP YOU LEARN SQL FASTER: -V
Queries: how you ask a database for data
Standard Query Language (SQL): how most queries work
Learn the RDB model to understand SQL
Entity-Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram): how the data is related
Relational Schemas: maps of the DB, missing info that is in the ERD
ERDPlus (Nened) -> online tool he made

HOW ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAMS WORK: -V
ER Diagrams communicate the structure of DB before making
Rectangles: Entities (catagories of data) -> tables
    Entity instance: and occurrence of the entity -> row
    Unique Attribute: the value that is unique for every entity instance -> column for IDs
Ovals: Attributes (aspects of a category) -> column
    Must be attached to and entity; unique for an entity
    Underlined if they are the unique attribute
Diamonds (+lines): show relationship between entity, word inside shows relationship
    One or multiple relationship between entities (ex. multiple addresses for contact?)
    Symbol closer and father represent the min and max instances of one entity in the other
    Symbol notation: | (one), < or > (many), M or N (infinity), O (optional, needs some other connection)
        (#min,#max) (specified numbers) -> always min = left and max = right

DATABASE STRUCTURES ILLUSTRATED BY ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAMS: -V
An attribute in parenthesis is defined by more attributes that aren't made into columns
Double rectangle: week entity
Dashed attribute: can't completely be unique -> can be unique if connect to entity with double diamond
Might sometimes need multiple tables for a query

RELATIONAL SCHEMAS: -V
Components of RS: Tables, Primary Keys, Foreign Keys
RS is a plan and is not equivalent to a RDB
Box: Relation (organization of the psychical basis of the DB) ~table
    Set of attributes (no order) ~columns
    Tuple (entry of the relation, no order) ~row
Primary Key: Unique identifier (only one)
There can be other unique columns (mark with U)
Foreign key: link tables (refer to unique ids on other tables, arrow to U, make FK)
    connections symbols can be used similar to the ERD
Many to Many relationship: multiple instances of one another (complicated), insert an entity in between
